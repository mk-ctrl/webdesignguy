# Laravel design patterns

Laravel is a popular PHP framework that is known for its elegant syntax and advanced features. In addition to its features, Laravel also has a strong emphasis on design patterns. Design patterns are solutions to common software design problems that have been tested and proven to work well. By using design patterns in Laravel, developers can create more efficient and maintainable code.

### The Model-View-Controller (MVC):

MVC pattern is one of the most commonly used design patterns in Laravel. MVC separates the application into three main components: the model, which represents the data, the view, which displays the data, and the controller, which handles the user input. This separation allows for better organization of code and makes it easier to maintain.

1. In Laravel, the MVC pattern is implemented in the following way:
    

* Model: A model in Laravel represents a database table and is used to interact with the database. For example, the User model in Laravel represents the users' table in the database and provides methods to retrieve, create, update, and delete users.
    
* View: A view in Laravel is a template that is used to display data. For example, the welcome.blade.php view in Laravel displays the welcome message to the user.
    
* Controller: A controller in Laravel handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly. For example, the UserController in Laravel handles the input from the user to create, update, or delete a user.
    

Model Example:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = [
        'name', 'email', 'password',
    ];
}
```

Controller Example:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\User;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    public function store(Request $request)
    {
        User::create([
            'name' => $request->name,
            'email' => $request->email,
            'password' => bcrypt($request->password),
        ]);

        return redirect()->back()->with('success', 'User created successfully.');
    }
}
```

View Example:

```php
<h1>Welcome to Laravel</h1>

<p>{{ $message }}</p>
```

### The Factory pattern :

This is another popular design pattern used in Laravel. It is used to create objects without having to specify the exact type of object that will be created. This pattern allows for better code reusability and makes it easier to change the type of object that is created without having to change the code.

In Laravel, the Factory pattern is implemented using the factory() method in the database/factories directory. For example, the UserFactory in Laravel can be used to create a new user without specifying the exact type of user that will be created.

```php
<?php

use App\User;
use Faker\Generator as Faker;

$factory->define(User::class, function (Faker $faker) {
    return [
        'name' => $faker->name,
        'email' => $faker->unique()->safeEmail,
        'password' => bcrypt('secret'),
    ];
});
```

### The Repository pattern:

The repository pattern is used to separate the logic for retrieving data from the actual storage of data. This separation allows for easier maintenance and makes it easier to switch between different data sources. In Laravel, the Eloquent ORM is a built-in implementation of the Repository pattern.

In Laravel, the Repository pattern is implemented using the Eloquent ORM. For example, the UserRepository in Laravel can be used to retrieve, create, update, and delete users from the database.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Repositories;

use App\User;

class UserRepository
{
    public function all()
    {
        return User::all();
    }

    public function create(array $data)
    {
        return User::create($data);
    }
}
```

### The Service Provider pattern:

Is a design pattern that is used to manage dependencies in Laravel. Service Providers are classes that provide a way to register and bootstrap services in Laravel. This pattern allows for better code organization and makes it easier to manage dependencies.

The Service Provider pattern is implemented using the register() and boot() methods. For example, the UserServiceProvider in Laravel can be used to register and bootstrap the UserService.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use App\Services\UserService;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class UserServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register()
    {
        $this->app->singleton(UserService::class, function ($app) {
            return new UserService();
        });
    }

    public function boot()
    {
        //
    }
}
```

### The Observer pattern:

This design pattern is used to manage events in Laravel. The Observer pattern allows for code to be notified when a certain event occurs. In Laravel, the Event class provides a way to manage events using the Observer pattern.

The observer pattern is implemented using the Event and Listener classes. For example, the UserCreatedEvent in Laravel can be used to notify listeners when a user is created.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Observers;

use App\User;

class UserObserver
{
    public function created(User $user)
    {
        // Do something after a user is created
    }
}
```

### Conventions:

Laravel conventions are established practices, rules, and naming conventions that developers are encouraged to follow when building applications with Laravel. These conventions help to maintain a consistent structure and style throughout the codebase, making it easier to read, understand, and maintain. Some of the most common Laravel conventions include:

1. Naming Conventions: Laravel has strict naming conventions for models, controllers, routes, views, and other components of the application. For example, models are typically named in the singular form and use PascalCase, while controllers are named in the plural form and use PascalCase followed by the word "Controller".
    
2. Directory Structure: Laravel has a well-defined directory structure, which makes it easy to find and organize files. For example, models are stored in the "app" directory, views in the "resources/views" directory, and controllers in the "app/Http/Controllers" directory.
    
3. Blade Templates: Laravel uses the Blade templating engine, which allows developers to easily create dynamic views by mixing HTML and PHP code. Blade templates use a simple syntax and provide a range of useful features, such as template inheritance and conditional statements.
    
4. Route Definitions: Laravel uses a simple and intuitive syntax to define routes in the "routes/web.php" or "routes/api.php" file. Developers can define the HTTP method, URI, and action that should be triggered when a user requests a specific URL.
    
5. Middleware: Laravel uses middleware to handle tasks that should run before or after a request is processed, such as authentication, authorization, and CSRF protection. Middleware can be defined in the "app/Http/Middleware" directory and can be easily assigned to routes or groups of routes.
    

These are just a few of the many conventions used in Laravel. By following these conventions, developers can create applications that are consistent, maintainable, and easy to understand.

Laravel has a strong emphasis on design patterns that help developers create more efficient and maintainable code. By using these patterns, developers can create applications that are easier to maintain and more scalable. Design patterns are a fundamental part of Laravel and are used in many parts of the framework to help developers create better code.
